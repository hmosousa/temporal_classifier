<TITLE>How Obama has weaponized wit</TITLE>
<TEXT>Barack Obama would <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e1" offsets="19 23" sent_idx="0">make</EVENT> a great stand-up comic, not because he's the funniest president ever but because he uses jokes the same way many of us comedians do: as a weapon.
Traditionally, the (intentionally) funny lines by our presidents have <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e4" offsets="240 243" sent_idx="1">had</EVENT> one thing in common: They were self-deprecating. Sure, some presidents have <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e5" offsets="320 324" sent_idx="1">used</EVENT> jokes to take jabs at their opponents, but not to the extent of Obama.
During his <TIMEX3 type="DURATION" value="P5Y" tid="t1" offsets="407 413" sent_idx="2">tenure</TIMEX3>, he has increasingly <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e8" offsets="435 444" sent_idx="2">unleashed</EVENT> biting comedic barbs against his critics and political adversaries. These jokes are <EVENT eid="e1000" class="I_ACTION" offsets="529 537" sent_idx="2">intended</EVENT> to do more than simply entertain you. They have an agenda.
Obama's humor is often delivered the way a comedian dealing with a heckler would do it. He <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e1002" offsets="688 693" sent_idx="3">tries</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e1003" offsets="697 706" sent_idx="3">undermine</EVENT> his opponents with it and get the crowd -- in this case the public -- on his side. I can <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e20" offsets="796 802" sent_idx="3">assure</EVENT> you that having a crowd laugh at your critic/heckler is not only effective in dominating them, it's also very satisfying.</TEXT>
